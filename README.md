# Text to Speech (Arabic text)

convert the  Arabic text to audio using Python, you can use the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library. This library allows you to convert text to speech using Google's Text-to-Speech API.

#### Here is an example of how to use the gTTS library to convert the extracted Arabic text to audio:

1- Import the required libraries:

```python
from gtts import gTTS
from io import BytesIO
```
##### The gtts library is used to convert the text to speech, while io library is used to work with bytes.

####
2- Read the contents of a text file

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    text = file.read()
```
####
3- Create a gTTS object:

```python
tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='ar')
```

##### The gTTS class is used to create a Text-to-Speech object. In this case, we create a new object and pass the extracted Arabic text to the text parameter, and set the language to Arabic using the lang parameter.

####
4- Use BytesIO to capture the audio content:

```python
audio_bytes = BytesIO()
tts.write_to_fp(audio_bytes)
```
##### BytesIO is a class that provides a buffer for bytes. In this case, we create a new BytesIO object to capture the audio content generated by the gTTS object. We then call the write_to_fp() method of the gTTS object to write the audio content to the BytesIO object.

####
5- Save the audio to a file or play it directly:

```python
with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
    f.write(audio_bytes.getbuffer())
```

##### Finally, we save the audio to a file named "output.mp3". We use a with statement to open the file in binary write mode ("wb") and write the audio content to the file using the write() method. Alternatively, you can play the audio directly using a media player library such as pyglet or pygame.

###
> **Note:**  the gTTS library requires an internet connection to communicate with Google's Text-to-Speech API, so make sure you have an active internet connection when running this code.
